# Transformer with Tensorflow

The idea for the model is from a YouTube video. I have changed the model a bit and the data is in different form than in the video. I have also used different BERT model and different dataset.

## GPU for training

Without GPU the training might the a long time. I have WSL2 with Ubuntu Linux in Windows 11. This is required to get the GPU version of Tensorflow working on Windows.
